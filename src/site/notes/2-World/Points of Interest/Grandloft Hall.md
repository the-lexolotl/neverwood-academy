# General

![Grandloft Hall.webp](/img/user/z_Assets/Maps/Grandloft%20Hall.webp)

**Category:** Landmark

### Description
The main Silverquill building is Grandloft Hall, a vast space with shafts of light streaking in from the enchanted windowpanes far above. Grandloft teems with balconies, loges, booths, daises, and other spaces where orators can perform their craft. Inklings, the collegeâ€™s mascots, flit around the high ceiling, and enchanted spotlights automatically focus on any mage who uses powerful magic.
