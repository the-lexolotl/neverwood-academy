# General

**Category:** Landmark

### Description
The centre of the Prismari campus is Conjurot Hall, a towering structure with a glassed-in observation area at the top. Constantly changing strands of elemental energy encircle the structure. Artist-mages can see for miles from Conjurotâ€™s main turret, and the view has inspired many artistic creations.
