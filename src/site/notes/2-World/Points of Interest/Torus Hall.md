# General

![Torus Hall.webp](/img/user/z_Assets/Maps/Torus%20Hall.webp)

**Category:** Landmark

### Description
The central hall of Quandrix campus lies at the end of a geometric series of walkways, terminating at ascending ramps to the towering building. Inside, Torus Hallâ€™s architecture is mapped to an ever-changing three-dimensional grid, which slowly evolves. Some Quandrix faculty members insist that mage-students shouldnâ€™t linger too long inside the hall, lest its geometry eventually turn itself inside out while students are still within it.
