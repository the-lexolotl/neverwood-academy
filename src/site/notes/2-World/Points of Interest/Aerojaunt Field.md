### Description
Aerojaunt Field was once the academy’s primary sports field. Now, years after the construction of [[2-World/Points of Interest/Neverwood Stadium\|Neverwood Stadium]] , the field sees far less use. Its official purpose is as a dedicated practice field for Neverwood’s high-profile student teams, whose official matches take place in newer facilities elsewhere on campus.

However, less competitive teams hold their matches on this field, most notably the Intramural Silkball Club. The elevated ramps used in silkball matches were permanently built into Aerojaunt Field, whose name evokes a popular silkball move that involves using magic to hop through the air.
