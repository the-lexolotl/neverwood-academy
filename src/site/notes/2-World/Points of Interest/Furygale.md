# General

![Furygale - 32x40 - 3200x4000 - light - grid.webp](/img/user/z_Assets/Maps/Furygale%20-%2032x40%20-%203200x4000%20-%20light%20-%20grid.webp)

**Category:** Landmark

### Description
At the outskirts of the Prismari campus, the abandoned creations of thousands of past artist-mages have coalesced over the years into the notorious region of Furygale. Roped off by magical wards and warning signs, Furygale is several acres of ever-changing magical energy, gales of ice and wind and fire, and elementals gone rogue. While dangerous, it also provides a source of wild inspiration, and it remains a popular spot for students who want to duel without being interrupted by faculty.
