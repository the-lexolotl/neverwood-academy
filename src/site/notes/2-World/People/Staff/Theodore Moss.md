Theodor is a gaunt, hunched man with overly long limbs and a bony face. His skin is pale, almost chalky, and his sunken eyes are a dark, deep shade of brown, bordering on black. Long, grey hair bristles in all directions like an unruly mane, and his face is crisscrossed with deep wrinkles and bushy eyebrows that are perpetually furrowed in worry. His nose is hooked and prominent, his lips thin and trembling, as if he is constantly muttering to himself. He wears torn, soiled robes resembling rags, but a keen eye will notice that these are travel-worn robes of high quality, with nearly invisible magical embroidery. He always carries a large, stuffed bag, which he clutches nervously—as if his life depended on it. Behaviour. Theodor appears distraught and erratic. He speaks incoherently, often raises his voice without clear reason, and gesticulates wildly. He easily falls into a panic but can also be surprisingly convincing when it comes to recovering his beloved familiar—a ginger cat, kidnapped, as he claims, by “small blue humanoids.”
