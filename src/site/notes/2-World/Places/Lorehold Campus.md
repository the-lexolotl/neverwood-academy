**Location:** [[2-World/Hubs/Neverwood Academy\|Neverwood Academy]]

**Category:** College Campus

### Description 
The Lorehold campus is situated northwest of the central campus in a region of stark vertical relief. Rugged mesas and steep hills rise from a wide plain, and a great chasm holds the excavated ruins of an ancient settlement. Several star arches encircle rocky peaks and outcroppings, testifying to the powerful magical energy in the vicinity â€” energy once harnessed by the ancients who used to inhabit this area.
