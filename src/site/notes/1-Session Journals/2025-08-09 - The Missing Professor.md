## Summary
After the chaos of the Autumn Equinox Feast and the first exams of the term, the students of Neverwood Academy found themselves drawn into a new mystery. A large, ancient tome fell from the library shelves, revealing secrets tied to the disappearance of [[2-World/People/Matreous\|Professor Matreous]] and the enigmatic extradimensional mansion of [[2-World/People/Other/Fistandria\|Fistandria]]. With careful investigation, clever deduction, and a daring entry through a locked office chimney, the party uncovered hidden notebooks, arcane scrolls, and the command word that opened a shimmering doorway into a strange and otherworldly space — a discovery that promised adventures far beyond the familiar campus halls.

### The Neverwood Times

The day began with the delivery of the latest **Neverwood Times**.  
 Two articles in particular caught the party’s attention:

* **"Feast Frogs Flood Equinox"** – detailing the chaos at the Autumn Equinox Feast and (somewhat unfairly) implying first-years were partly to blame.  
* **"One Year On: The Disappearance of Professor Matreous"** – marking the anniversary of the mysterious vanishing of Professor Matreous from his office.

### Exams Begin

With the festive distractions behind them, the students buckled down for **exam season**:

* **First Exam:** *General Studies – “A is for Ankheg”*  
* Afterwards, while shelving books, a **large tome** unexpectedly fell to the floor.

### The Book

* Title: **"The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces"**  
* Cover: Illustration of **Mordenkainen**  
* Inside: Several **handwritten notes** in the margins, plus a **library slip** revealing that Professor Matreous last checked it out on **28th Hammer, 1507**.

Cynith tucked the book away for safekeeping and the party sought answers.

### Investigating Matreous

The Librarian [[2-World/People/Isabrough\|Isabrough]] described Matreous as:

* *Eccentric*,  
* A specialist in **Planar Theory**,  
* Known for guarding his workspace fiercely.

The Librarian directed them to **[[2-World/Points of Interest/Pillardrop\|Pillardrop]]** on [[2-World/Places/Lorehold Campus\|Lorehold Campus]] — a vast ravine crammed with offices and buildings.

### Whalebucks Interlude

The group made a brief stop at Whalebucks, where they met [[2-World/People/Losheel\|Professor Losheel]] of Lorehold:

* Losheel recalled Matreous as brilliant but “a bit mad.”  
* Claimed Matreous believed he was on the brink of a major discovery.  
* Shortly before his disappearance, he had specifically requested a new office and kept students out entirely.

### Matreous’s Office

Finding the correct office locked, **Lyra** flew in through the chimney and opened the door. Inside, the group found:

* Several books on **Interdimensional Travel** & **Extradimensional Magic**  
* A **small notebook** of Matreous’s ramblings about an extradimensional mansion belonging to **[[2-World/People/Other/Fistandria\|Fistandria]], which he claimed to have located in her former office  
* Theories that the entrance required a specific command word 

They also investigated a heavy statue by the door, eventually toppling it to reveal:
* **Two spell scrolls**
* **A small pouch of coins**

### Epiphany

Piecing together their findings, the group realised:

* **Fistandria’s office** and **Matreous’s office** were in the same location  
* The **command word** was clearly highlighted in *Fistandria’s copy* of *The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces*

Speaking the word aloud caused **a shimmering extradimensional doorway** to appear before them…

### Session Themes

* First clear link between the party’s discoveries and a long-standing campus mystery  
* Shift from slice-of-life student life into deeper planar intrigue  
* Stronger presence of Lorehold and its eccentric staff

### Ongoing Threads

* **Professor Matreous:** His disappearance remains unresolved; evidence points to extradimensional exploration.  
* **Extradimensional Mansion of Fistandria:** First clues discovered; potential key to further planar mysteries.  
* **Lorehold Faculty Secrets:** Professors are eccentric and may hold hidden knowledge that could help (or hinder) the party.  
* **Campus Mysteries:** How do student life, exams, and faculty politics intersect with planar magic and otherworldly phenomena?
