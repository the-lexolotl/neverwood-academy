## Summary
The students of Neverwood settled into their first proper week of academic life, navigating the balance between classes, downtime adventures, and the ever-surprising magic of campus life.

### Downtime Recap Highlights

Each student shared a glimpse into their solo adventures between sessions:
* Kristy   
  * Heard a spicy rumour: Professor [[2-World/People/Mavinda Sharpbeak\|Mavinda Sharpbeak]] may be romantically involved with Dean [[2-World/People/Shaile Talonrook\|Shaile Talonrook]].  
* Megan  
  * Explored the backstage storage beneath [[2-World/Points of Interest/The Rose Stage\|The Rose Stage]] on [[2-World/Places/Silverquill Campus\|Silverquill Campus]], learning about its hidden passages and supply rooms.  
* Rain  
  * Experimented with colour-changing potions — though she accidentally spilt one on her textbook and wiped it with her robe, both now partially rainbow-hued.  
* Ross  
  * Found a cryptic note in a textbook margin:  
    “From nothing comes great responsibility – Author Unknown.”  
    Its meaning remains unclear.  
* Theo  
  * Investigated [[2-World/Points of Interest/The Cultivarium\|The Cultivarium]] on [[2-World/Places/Quandrix Campus\|Quandrix Campus]], discovering that some of the flora seem semi-sentient.

### First Week of Classes Begins

Students attended their first official lessons and completed Homework Rolls for Week 1\. Subjects and outcomes varied, with some players already beginning to show academic strengths or struggles.

### Frog Racing Incident – Firejolt Café

While relaxing on campus, the group was approached by other students who invited them to spectate the popular (but ethically questionable) Frog Racing at [[2-World/Points of Interest/Firejolt Café\|The Firejolt Café.]]

#### Events Unfold:

* The group visited the café and discovered frogs dressed in themed costumes, prepped for magical racing.  
* Several players expressed discomfort with the concept, viewing it as animal cruelty.  
* Attempts were made to convince the frogs not to race, but the frogs misinterpreted and launched into the event anyway.  
* During the race, one frog began to grow rapidly, mutating unnaturally.  
* In the chaos, Harry (Ross) summoned a bonfire that tragically incinerated five small frogs.  
* The giant frog, now enraged, tried to attack.  
* The party calmed the creature, who then vomited up a mass of thick black goo before shrinking back to normal size and fleeing.  
* The frog bolted through the café and was intercepted and captured by [[2-World/People/Osgir, the Reconstructor\|Professor Osgir]], the Reconstructor, Lorehold’s Professor of Order.

### Aftermath & Mysterious Goo

The party questioned  [[2-World/People/Osgir, the Reconstructor\|Professor Osgir]] about the black goo. He didn’t provide much, but confirmed the anomaly would be reviewed with other faculty.  
The nature and source of the goo remains unknown, but this marks the third magical anomaly encountered on campus in three weeks.

### Week 2 Homework

Students completed their Week 2 Homework Rolls, applying lessons from their first classes. Some students are thriving, while others may be falling behind…

### Session Themes

* Transition into academic life  
* Campus chaos with magical consequences  
* Ethical questions in a magical world  
* Another clue to a brewing magical disturbance

### Ongoing Threads

* Strange magical disruptions:  
  * Week 1: Mimic  
  * Week 2: Ochre Jelly  
  * Week 3: Mutating Frog & Black Goo  
* The goo is a potential clue toward something festering in the magical weave  
* Student rumours: Sharpbeak & Talonrook relationship?  
* Ross’s textbook mystery — a potential lead or prophecy?
