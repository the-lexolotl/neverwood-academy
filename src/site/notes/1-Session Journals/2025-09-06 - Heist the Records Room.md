## Summary
After weeks of strange discoveries and half-answers, the party resolved to take matters into their own hands. Their target: the **student records office**, in hopes of uncovering information about the mysterious **[[2-World/People/Daniel Murgaxor\|Daniel Murgaxor]]**. What began as a clever infiltration quickly spiralled into chaos, leaving behind wrecked doors, a destroyed security bot, and stolen files that could change everything.
### Festival to Infiltration
* The group gathered at [[2-World/Points of Interest/Opus Walk\|Opus Walk]], [[2-World/Places/Prismari Campus\|Prismari Campus]], after spending the day at the **Genesia Festival** on Central Campus.  
* Cyinth was running late, so while waiting, **Glue got a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/masquerade-tattoo-tce\|Masquerade Tattoo]]** at *Opus Ink* — screaming and crying through the entire process.  
* Once everyone regrouped, they made for the admin offices under cover of night.
### Breaking In
* Milfjord “accidentally” broke the main lock while forcing the door.  
* The party split up to search:  
	  * Glue set **Buhloop** (his octopus familiar) on the wall as a lookout.  
	  * Vigilius found a slip of paper with a **number** in the student life offices.  
	  * Glue uncovered a hidden **key** beneath a potted plant in reception.  
	  * Using it, he entered a locked office containing an **automaton**, another slip of paper, and left a **snare trap** behind before relocking the door.
### The Puzzle & the Fight
* Advancing cautiously, the party reached a **colour-coded lock** to the Head Teacher’s office.  
* After several attempts, they solved the puzzle and gained entry, finding yet another slip of paper among the scattered documents.  
* Meanwhile, Milfjord chatted with Buhloop — loudly enough to **alert a security autognome**.  
* An autognome emerged from a bathroom right in front of Cyinth, triggering combat:  
  * Harry, Cyinth, and Atudark were all knocked unconscious during the fight.  
  * Buhloop dove onto the bot’s face in a desperate attempt to help.  
  * Lyra revived her friends, while Glue joined the fray. Together, the group finally destroyed the autognome.
### The Records Room

* While the fight raged, Lyra tried brute-forcing the code to the **records room**, missing two numbers.  
* Eventually, she succeeded, rushed inside, and grabbed three files with the surname **Murgaxor** before bolting out and shouting at everyone to flee.  
* The group retreated in a hurry, carrying the bot’s head with them and leaving the broken body behind.
### Aftermath

* Back in the **first-year common room**, the students argued over who would hold the stolen records.  
* In the end, they split the files between **Harry** and **Lyra**, then headed to bed — battered, bickering, and burdened with dangerous knowledge.
### **Ongoing Threads**
* **Daniel Murgaxor**   
	  * Three files retrieved, but what secrets do they contain?  
* **Security Breach**   
	  * A destroyed autognome and broken locks will not go unnoticed. Will the faculty trace it back to them?  
* **Buhloop the Octopus**  
	  * Once again proving unexpectedly helpful (and surprisingly chatty, thanks to Milfjord).  
* **Faculty Suspicion**  
	  * How long before professors piece together the party’s role in repeated campus chaos?  
* **The Bigger Picture**  
	  * Between Fistandria’s return, black goo experiments, and now the Murgaxor files, the threads are starting to connect.
