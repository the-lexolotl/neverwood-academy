## Summary
After a tense few weeks of magical mishaps and escalating frog-related chaos, the students of Neverwood Academy gathered for the grand Autumn Equinox Feast — a celebration of the season, the end of the first half of term, and the community they were beginning to build.

### Week 3 Homework Rolls

Before the festivities began, students completed their Week 3 homework rolls, reflecting the mounting academic pressure as exams approached. Successes and failures were noted — some students are flourishing, others... less so.

### Whalebucks Autumn Menu Launched

In celebration of the season, Whalebucks unveiled its Autumn 1508 Specialty Drinks, including:
* Pumpkin Cauldron Latte  
* Feyspice Fog  
* Falling Star Chai  
* Gingersap Pop-Tarts
These magically-enhanced drinks became a highlight of the week, with many students using them to stay awake through late-night study sessions.

### The Autumn Equinox Feast

Held in the transformed Biblioplex Hall, the Feast featured:
* Enchanted décor with glowing leaves, twilight illusions, and seasonal food magic  
* Showcases from various clubs and student groups, performing demonstrations, readings, musical acts, and magical displays to highlight their Term 1 accomplishments  
* The players happily indulged in food and drink, enjoying the brief peace

### The “Solution” to the Frog Problem

Midway through the feast, two student researchers took to the stage, excited to present what they claimed was a magical solution to the recent frog infestations.

* One held up a small vial of green liquid, claiming it would repel or neutralize the frog invasion magic.  
* Unfortunately, the student accidentally dropped the vial, shattering it on the floor.

### Frog Swarm Chaos

* The liquid released a sickly-sweet scent that spread rapidly.  
* The smell immediately began attracting frogs from all across campus.  
* Dozens — possibly hundreds — of frogs invaded the feast hall, leaping over tables, knocking over food, and sending students fleeing.

The party chose to stay behind and face the frog invasion head-on.
* In the ensuing chaos, Harry (Ross’s player) was knocked unconscious by a leaping frog swarm but was heroically revived by Lyra, a fellow student.  
* The group fought bravely and eventually drove off or subdued all the invading frogs, though the hall was left in utter disarray.  
* Staff award 100 points to each group

### Session Themes

* Celebration cut short by consequences of student magic  
* Frog mystery continues to escalate  
* The party earns respect (again) for staying behind when others fled  
* Hint of dangerous experimentation from other student researchers

### Ongoing Threads

* Who made the green liquid — and what exactly was it intended to do?  
* Why are the frogs still being drawn to specific magical stimuli?  
* Pattern of magical disruptions continues:  
  * Week 1: Mimic  
  * Week 2: Ochre Jelly  
  * Week 3: Giant Frog & Goo  
  * Week 4: Frog Swarm Invasion  
* The name “frog invasion” is starting to be whispered around campus…
