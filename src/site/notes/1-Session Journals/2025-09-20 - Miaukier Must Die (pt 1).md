## Summary

The party left the safety of Neverwood Academy, supplied with tents, rations, and determination. Their first real expedition into the wider world quickly proved dangerous ‚Äî rivers to cross, bandits to face, and a strange blue-skinned menace ahead. What began as a search for a missing cat soon led them into fire and blood, as the group clashed with the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/xvart-mpmm\|Xvart]], uncovering signs of gruesome rituals and something far darker stirring beneath the forest floor.

### üèïÔ∏è Preparations & Setting Out

* The group stocked up on **camping supplies** and potions before leaving campus.  
* Cyinth spoke with **[[2-World/People/Yedora\|Yedora]] the groundskeeper**, learning that the small blue goblins were likely **Xvarts** ‚Äî creatures rumoured to dwell in Neverwinter Woods. Yedora pointed her to a **[[Xvart Info Sheets.png|textbook page]]** for more details.  
* With this knowledge, the students headed northwest toward the reported settlement. 
### üåä The River Crossing
* After hours of travel, the party reached a **50ft-wide river**.  
* Lyra and Cyinth simply flew across, leaving the rest to puzzle out a crossing.  
* Vigilius tied a rope, but when Harry was halfway across, **Cyinth cut it**, sending him into the current.  
* Vigilius dove in to save him, while Harry conjured an underwater bonfire, creating enough steam to stabilize them until they reached the bank.  
* The rescue succeeded ‚Äî but tempers flared over Cyinth‚Äôs reckless action.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Bandits in the Night

* The group camped in a forest clearing. Harry and Cyinth set magical alarms.  
* In the night, **two bandits** triggered the wards. Cyinth blasted one with a **Guiding Bolt**, killing him instantly.  
* The second bandit begged for mercy and was spared under promise never to return.  
* Harry tried to burn the body, but ended up cooking it instead. Lyra insisted on a **proper pyre**, to keep Cyinth from snacking on it.

### üî• Fire from the Sky

* The next day, Lyra and Cyinth scouted ahead, spotting a **Xvart encampment** with towers and a great bonfire.  
* The group prepared **explosive potions**. Cyinth and Lyra dropped them from above, igniting chaos in the settlement.  
* Amid the flames, Cyinth pinned a fat Xvart who carried a golden fork. She stole it and demanded to know where Miaukier was.  
* The terrified Xvart pointed them to a nearby cave.

### ü©∏ The Blood-Stained Caverns

* Entering the cave, the group followed a **trail of blood** down into worked stone corridors.  
* Behind one door, they found a **horrifying room of corpses**, long dead and fresh alike, piled together.  
	  * Harry vomited. Vigilius fled the room.  
	  * Lyra examined the bodies, noting wildly different times of death.  
	  * At the back, Cyinth broke open a **chest of loot**.  
* Further exploration revealed:  
	  * A **tripwire trap**, nearly hitting Vigilius.  
	  * An **octagonal chamber**, where Lyra brewed a willow-bark painkiller.  
	  * A **crate-strewn storage room**, with another dead body missing an arm.  
	  * A **hidden door**, behind which lay a **chest of coins and jewels**.

### Ongoing Threads

* **[[2-World/People/Miaukier\|Miaukier]]‚Äôs Fate** ‚Äì The cat is still missing. The cave may yet hold answers.  
* **[[2-World/People/Theodore Moss\|Theodore Moss]]‚Äôs Warning** ‚Äì His ramblings of a ‚Äúlarger leader‚Äù with black eyes linger in the party‚Äôs mind.  
* **The Xvarts** ‚Äì Who do they serve? What compels their rituals?  
* **The Golden Fork** ‚Äì A strange trophy from a fatter Xvart. Does it signify leadership or something more sinister?
* **Trust in the Party** ‚Äì Friction is growing: Cyinth cutting the rope, Harry nearly cooked by accident, Lyra enforcing morals. Will these tensions boil over?
