## Summary
The students of Neverwood Academy stepped boldly into the unknown, finding themselves trapped inside Fistandria’s mysterious extradimensional mansion. Within its shifting rooms and enchanted laboratories, they uncovered puzzle books, battled animated objects, and pieced together the command word needed to escape. But freedom came at a cost — for when they finally reopened the portal, they found Professor Matreous lying dead in his office, with secrets older and stranger than they could have imagined stirring in the shadows.

### Entering the Mansion

- The party met [[2-World/People/Matreous\|Professor Matreous]], stranded inside the mansion.
- He revealed he had discovered many curiosities within, including a carved wooden [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/fiend/imp-xmm\|imp]] figurine, but could not reopen the portal himself.
- He offered to hold the doorway open — but upon stepping through, the students heard him scream. The portal closed behind him, trapping them inside.

### Kitchen & Homunculi

- Vigilius explored the kitchen and encountered [[2-World/People/Cumin\|Cumin]] and [[2-World/People/Coriander\|Coriander]], two chatty [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/homunculus-xmm\|homunculi]].
- They explained [[2-World/People/Fistandria\|Fistandria]] created Cumin, and another mage, [[2-World/People/Freyot\|Freyot]], created Coriander.
- Cumin let slip that the command word to reopen the portal was hidden across puzzle books scattered throughout the mansion.

### First Discoveries

- Harry found a study containing a duplicate of The Joy of Extradimensional Spaces, marked with the letter I on its spine. He also befriended a cat, which loyally followed him thereafter.
- Cyinth stumbled upon an [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/construct/animated-broom-xmm\|animated broom]] diligently sweeping, then searched a library but found nothing useful at the time.
- Lyra ventured upstairs, discovering a vast alchemy lab and a star map depicting a five-star constellation.

### The Planetarium Puzzle

- Lyra realised the star map matched the planetarium above. By aligning five telescopes with the constellation, she unlocked a secret room containing:
	- A chained bookcase
	- A puzzle book with the letter L
	- Investigation revealed the chains were not secured with a lock — and bore strange stretch marks on the floor.

### Library Battles

- Cyinth later discovered another puzzle book with the letter T in the laboratory.
- Working together, she and Lyra attempted to dissolve the chains with an acidic concoction. Instead, the bookcase erupted, flinging animated books at them.
- They fled, but not before retrieving the puzzle books they’d uncovered.

### Trophy Room & Bedroom

- In the trophy room, they found another book with the letter Y, while uneasy mounted heads glared from the walls.
- In the adjoining bedroom, they located a book with the letter E, and Cyinth scooped up a tabby cat, cradling it like a baby.
- Harry rejoined here, cat in tow, creating quite the menagerie.

### Dining Room Danger

- Vigilius inspected a suspicious chair — which promptly bit him.
- The others rushed to his aid:
	- Harry dashed inside.
	- Cyinth attempted to fly in from the balcony, but crashed full-speed into the window.
	- Lyra provided support from outside.
- Together, they defeated the chair [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic-xmm\|mimic-xmm]]. Cyinth later discovered two [[3-Mechanics/CLI/items/driftglobe-xdmg\|Driftglobes]] in the patio garden, keeping one and gifting the other to Lyra.

### Basement Secrets

- The homunculi returned, tending to Vigilius’s robes and mentioning that Fistandria kept a second lab in the basement.
- Harry quickly uncovered the hidden entrance in the study, leading the group below.
- They found:
	- Another puzzle book, marked B.
	- A summoning chamber, where a frog-like creature unsettled Harry.
	- A storage room full of jars containing bizarre creatures — including a [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/aberration/slaad-tadpole-xmm\|Slaad Tadpole]].

### The Last Puzzle Book

- Returning to the upstairs library, the group searched again.
- After a mishap where Harry was buried under a cascade of falling books, they discovered the final volume with the letter R.
- With the books assembled, the command word became clear: LIBERTY.

### Back to Reality

- Speaking the word opened the portal back to Matreous’s office.
- Inside, they found the professor dead and cold, long since lifeless — despite having just spoken with him.
- To avoid suspicion, the group devised a quick cover story:
	- Cyinth mimicked a school alarm.
	- Deans [[2-World/People/Augusta Tullus\|Augusta Tullus]] and [[2-World/People/Plargg\|Plargg]] arrived to investigate.
	- Augusta determined Matreous had been dead for several days, with signs of death by a small creature.
	- An Imp attacked Plargg during the inspection, but the students helped defeat it.

The deans thanked the group, dismissed them to their dorms, and promised to handle matters quietly.

### Aftermath

- Confused and shaken, the students returned to campus life.
- Cyinth offered to cook for the group, while Lyra promised to help fund the feast.

For now, the portal was closed, Matreous was dead, and questions about Fistandria’s mansion — and what lurked within — remained unanswered.

### Ongoing Threads

- Professor Matreous’s Death
	- How could the party have spoken with him alive inside the mansion if his body has been cold in the office for days? Who or what was really guiding them?
- Fistandria’s Mansion
	- The books, labs, and homunculi hinted at vast magical research. What else lies hidden in her extradimensional space, and why was it abandoned?
- The Wooden Imp Figurine
	- Matreous claimed it was “one of many curiosities” he found, but it vanished with him. Could it be connected to the Imp that attacked Dean Plargg?
- The Command Word Books
    - The chained puzzle tomes spelled out Liberty, but why did Fistandria scatter the solution across her home? Was she protecting something — or hiding it?
- The Slaad Tadpole
    - The jarred creatures in the basement, especially the tadpole, suggest planar or extraplanar experiments. What dangers could they bring to campus if loosed?
- Cats of the Mansion
    - Two friendly cats now accompany the students. Harmless mascots… or familiars with a deeper link to the mansion?
- The Deans’ Investigation
    - Augusta and Plargg know Matreous’s death is not simple. How much will they share with the students — and how much will they expect the students to uncover?
- The Feast to Come
    Cyinth and Lyra’s planned group dinner promises a brief reprieve from danger, but will it become the stage for new revelations or complications?
