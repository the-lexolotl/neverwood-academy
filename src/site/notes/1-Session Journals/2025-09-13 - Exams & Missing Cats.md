## Summary

After weeks of classes, research, and tense investigations, the students finally reached the end of their first exam period. With some celebrating success and others licking their wounds, the group gathered at the Bow’s End Tavern to relax. But their evening of drinks and laughter was cut short by a ragged stranger and a desperate plea: his cat, **Miaukier**, had been taken into the depths of Neverwood Forest by strange, rat-like goblin creatures. With half-term break now upon them, the party resolved to embark on their first true expedition beyond the academy walls.

### Exams & Tavern Talk

* Players caught up on **homework rolls**.  
* The group completed a **quiz on mechanics and classes**.  
* They rolled for exams: most passed, but **Theo failed**.  
* After the final exam (25th Uktar, 1508), the group met at the [[2-World/Points of Interest/Bow's End Tavern\|Bow's End Tavern]], sharing drinks and swapping stories.  
* Milfjord attempted to **synthesise a potion** from tavern drinks, with mixed success.

### The Stranger Arrives

* The tavern door burst open to reveal an **old man in rags, covered in mud**, shouting about his missing cat.  
* The group calmed him, offered him a drink, and listened to his story.

### The Blue Goblins

The man, trembling, described his experience in **Neverwood Forest**:

* Strange, **small goblin-like creatures**, bluish-grey, moving with terrifying synchronicity.  
* Their heads resembled a mix of **goblin and rodent**, with long snouts, yellow glowing eyes, and jagged teeth.  
* They wore **filthy rags, bone belts, and crude masks** of clay and feathers, like mock-shamans.  
* He claimed they moved like a **swarm of rats**, as if listening to an unseen voice.  
* Among them was a **larger leader**, with a clawed helmet and dark black eyes, who pointed him out.  
* The man feigned death, escaped… but left his cat, **Miaukier**, behind.

### The Map

* After sobbing into his drink, the party asked his name: **[[2-World/People/Theodore Moss\|Theodore Moss]]**.  
* Theodore pulled out a **map**, pointing to a location deep in Neverwood Forest, a day and a half’s journey away.  
* The group agreed to help find [[2-World/People/Miaukier\|Miaukier]], deciding to use their **half-term holidays** to prepare and travel into the forest.

### Plans & Preparation

* The party discussed their approach over drinks, weighing what supplies they’d need for the journey.  
* They retired to their dorms, planning to **shop for camping equipment and provisions** before setting off into Neverwood the next morning.

### Ongoing Threads

* **Theodore Moss & Miaukier** – A missing cat, a strange new goblin-like race, and hints of something sinister in Neverwood.  
* **Exams** – Most passed, but Theo failed — how will this affect their standing in term two?  
* **The Forest Expedition** – Their first extended trip outside campus: survival, supplies, and dangers await.  
* **Blue Goblins** – Who are these creatures? What is the unseen voice they follow? And why did they take the cat?
