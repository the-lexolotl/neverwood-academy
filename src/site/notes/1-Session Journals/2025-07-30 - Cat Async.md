## Summary

Curious and increasingly suspicious about the mimic incident during Orientation Day, Cynth (Catarina) took it upon herself to investigate further, beginning with a research trip to the Biblioplex.

### Research Attempts

Cynth sought out books on mimics in the school’s [[2-World/Points of Interest/Biblioplex\|central library]]. While the Librarian [[2-World/People/Staff/Isabrough\|Isabrough]] was polite and helpful, she was ultimately led to an empty shelf, where the relevant books had seemingly been checked out.  
The Librarian recommended she speak to the Animal Studies faculty for better information.  
This marks the second recent incident of missing or misfiled magical creature texts, subtly building a pattern.

### Conversations with Witherbloom Faculty

Determined to learn more, Cynth visited the Witherbloom Deans for answers.

#### [[2-World/People/Lissette\|Dean Lissette]] (Medicine & Draconic Studies)

Explained that mimics were outside her speciality.  
Mentioned that her focus lies in medicine and dragon biology.  
Directed Cynth toward Dean Valentin.

#### [[2-World/People/Valentin\|Dean Valentin]] (Life & Decay Magic)

Had no books available, but offered something better:  
“Would you like to see one?”  
Cynth accepted the invitation to view a live mimic, and Valentin led her deep into the Detention Bog behind [[2-World/Places/Witherbloom Campus\|Witherbloom Campus]].

### The [[2-World/Points of Interest/Detention Bog\|Detention Bog]] & [[2-World/People/Yedora\|Groundskeeper Yedora]]

Outside the bog, Valentin knocked on what appeared to be a wooden hut.  
The hut transformed into a treant, revealing itself to be Yedora, the Groundskeeper.  
Yedora escorted them through the twisted forest, eventually reaching a stairwell that descended underground.  
They followed a winding path:

> Arriving at a metal door marked: Room **100.762**

### Mimic Observation Room

The room was small, dim, and stone-walled.  
At the centre stood a stone plinth, upon which sat a golden cup — clearly the mimic.  
As Valentin invited Cynth to observe, she triggered her pendant to emit a high-pitched magical sound, disturbing the mimic and the entire surrounding dungeon.  
The cup began to tremble, and animalistic noises echoed from further within the underground complex.  
Valentin sharply told her off, and she stopped the noise.  
He then gave her a brief lecture on mimics, describing:

* Their natural gelatinous form  
* How they adapt to mimic objects  
* Their immunity to acid  
* Their origin is likely tied to adaptive survival magic

### Speculation on the Biblioplex Incident

On their way back up, Cynth asked about the mimic from Orientation Day.  
Valentin offered his theory:  
“That wasn’t a true mimic. I suspect illusion magic was layered over a mundane object — perhaps a test or prank. Or something designed to look like a mimic, to trigger a reaction.”  
This casts new doubt over the incident and raises the question of why someone would fake a mimic attack during the treasure hunt.

### Session Themes

Investigating magical anomalies through academic channels  
First glimpse of the dangerous, contained parts of the Academy  
Growing hints that something deeper is wrong — illusions, misinformation, missing texts  
Catarina proving herself as an independent and curious arcane investigator
