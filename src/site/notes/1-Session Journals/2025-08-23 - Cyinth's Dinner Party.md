## Summary
After the tension of Fistandria’s mansion and the shocking death of Professor Matreous, the students of Neverwood Academy took a rare moment to relax and reconnect. Cyinth hosted a lively dinner in the first-year common room, complete with savoury stew, tarts, and flowing wine. Conversations ranged from personal histories and first magical experiences to strategising their next moves in the ongoing mysteries surrounding the mansion and black goo. Despite a magical mishap that saw Lyra temporarily storm off, the evening ended with the group united in purpose — planning to investigate student records, gather more information, and prepare for the challenges ahead.

### Dinner Party

* Cyinth prepped and cooked the meal, keeping everyone fed and entertained.  
* Glue demonstrated a magical experiment, accidentally causing [[2-World/People/Greta Gorunn\|Greta Gorunn]] to lose control of her bladder.  
* Lyra confronted Glue, briefly engaging in a heated magical skirmish that left Glue lightly burned. Lyra stormed off to her dorm in anger.  
* Cyinth went to coax Lyra back, calming tensions while finishing meal preparations.

### Conversations and Sharing

* Vigilius, Harry, Atudark, and Glue discussed their experiences in Fistandria’s mansion, the black goo, and potential next steps.  
* Harry asked the group about their home lives and magical beginnings, prompting Vigilius to share extensive details about his upbringing and parents.  
* Vigilius discovered burning meat in the kitchen and rescued it, later simmering it in a stock with Cyinth’s guidance.

### Dinner and Strategy

* Cyinth served the meal: meat stew, tarts, and wine.  
* The group discussed how to continue their investigations, focusing on accessing student records:  
* Cyinth disguised herself to speak with a campus guide automaton and discovered the location of the records, though her disguise was seen through.  
* Lyra offered to talk to staff about the student administration offices.  
* Dinner concluded with the group sharing stories, enjoying the meal, and planning their next moves.

### Ongoing Threads

* Fistandria’s Mansion & Black Goo  
  * Understanding the mansion’s magical traps and objects remains crucial.  
* Student Records Investigation  
  * The group aims to access records to uncover further secrets and connections.  
* Campus Politics & Staff Secrets  
  * Automata and staff may hold valuable information or impede investigations.  
* Interpersonal Dynamics  
  * Glue’s mischief, Lyra’s temper, and the group’s growing trust are shaping alliances and tensions.  
* Upcoming Mysteries  
  * Clues from previous sessions hint at deeper plots involving planar magic, hidden books, and possibly other dangers still lurking on campus.
