## Summary
After piecing together the secrets of Professor Matreous’s disappearance, the students of Neverwood Academy decided to risk a second journey into **Fistandria’s extradimensional mansion**. What began as another cautious investigation quickly turned tense when the mansion’s true master returned. Forced to think fast, hide, and eventually flee, the group left with more questions than answers — and the looming certainty that they had drawn the attention of a powerful mage.

### Back Through the Portal

* The party returned to **Professor [[2-World/People/Staff/Matreous\|Matreous]]'s office**, spoke the command word, and stepped once more into the extradimensional mansion.  
* Dust covered most surfaces — time had clearly passed since their last visit.  
* In the **kitchen**, the homunculi, **[[2-World/People/Other/Cumin\|Cumin]] and [[2-World/People/Other/Coriander\|Coriander]]**, confirmed that a couple of weeks had gone by. They apologised for the mess, explaining they’d been too busy to keep the mansion tidy.

### Exploring Again

* The group returned to the **chained bookcase room**:  
	  * Lyra repositioned the telescopes to reopen the secret chamber.  
	  * Glue and Harry investigated but found nothing new, even with Buhloop the octopus checking behind the shelves.  
* Cyinth and Lyra ventured into the **bedroom**, where they found and fussed over the orange cat. Lyra later hid the cat in her clothes.  
* H’er and Milfjord lingered in the **trophy room**, smoking and taking notes about the mansion.

### Fistandria Returns

* A **doorbell chime** echoed through the mansion. The homunculi celebrated, crying out that their master had returned.  
* The group panicked and split:  
	  * **Lyra and Cyinth** hid on the roof.  
	  * **Milfjord, Vigilius, and H’er** jumped outside the mansion to hide in the grounds.  
	  * **Harry, Glue, and Atudark** were found inside and confronted by Fistandria herself.  
* Fistandria demanded answers, dragging the group downstairs. Glue let slip something about “Neverwood” and people hiding on the roof.  
* Fistandria summoned Lyra and Cyinth back down, though Lyra managed to keep the cat hidden.

### A Fiery Distraction

* Cyinth asked to retrieve something upstairs but instead **set fire to the upper laboratory**, creating chaos.  
* While Fistandria was distracted trying to contain the blaze, she forced half the group back through the portal to Matreous’s office.  
* The remaining students waited for their chance, then made a daring dash back inside and through the portal before Fistandria could catch them.

### Aftermath

* The party regrouped in the **common room**, shaken but safe.  
* They now knew one thing for certain: **Fistandria was alive, powerful, and aware of them.**

### Ongoing Threads

* **Fistandria’s Mansion** – Still holds many secrets; her connection to Matreous and the books remains unclear.  
* **Fistandria Herself** – Now aware of the party; a dangerous and unpredictable figure.  
* **The Orange Cat** – Rescued (and hidden) by Lyra; unclear if ordinary or magical.  
* **The Black Goo** – Still unresolved, and possibly linked to planar magic.  
* **Student Records Heist** – The party still plans to infiltrate the admin offices for more information.  
* **Faculty Suspicions** – How long before staff notice the students’ repeated involvement in magical chaos?
