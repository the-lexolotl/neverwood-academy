## Summary
Determined to uncover more information about strange magical occurrences on campus — particularly the black goo from the Firejolt incident — Ross, accompanied by fellow student [[2-World/People/Students/Cadoras Damellawar\|Cadoras Damellawar]], planned and executed a stealthy break-in at the [[2-World/Points of Interest/Biblioplex\|Biblioplex]].

### The Plan

* Cadoras cast Detect Magic in preparation.  
* Ross and Cadoras snuck into the ground floor, hiding out of sight.  
* Ross cast Thunderwave on a bookshelf, creating a huge noise and scattering books — which successfully lured nearby cogwork archivists away from the staircase.  
* Ross then quietly cast Create Bonfire on one of the automatons, causing panic among the constructs.  
* The chaos finally drew down a Shield Guardian from the upper level.

### Infiltrating the Upper Floor

* As the guardian descended, Ross and Cadoras used the distraction to sneak upstairs undetected.  
* Upstairs, they found the central library and study rooms — typically reserved for upper-year students.  
* While Cadoras searched magically for threats, Ross began looking for relevant research materials.

❗ One Shield Guardian was still unaccounted for, believed to be behind a closed door.

### What Harry Found

Harry retrieved:

* "Goops, Goos and Gunk" – a book on magical slimes and oozes  
* A notebook with handwritten notes on animating objects  
* A history of Dragonborn tribes in Tymanther  
* And, despite being over-encumbered, grabbed a book on Aganazzar of Neverwinter (Evocation specialist)

No windows were available, and the magically reinforced walls were blast-proof — there was no easy exit.

### The Escape (…Almost)

* Cadoras sensed the remaining guardian moving.  
* The duo attempted to sneak back downstairs.  
* Ross spotted [[2-World/People/Verelda Lang\|Professors Lang]] and [[2-World/People/Kianne\|Dean Kianne]] at the base of the stairs, investigating the earlier fire.  
* A Thaumaturgy distraction failed — Lang suspected the students were still in the building and began heading upstairs.

Ross handed the books to Cadoras, who escaped via the floor’s teleporter, promising to regroup the next morning.  
In a final, desperate move, Ross:

* Cast Light on his Quandrix pendant  
* Threw it toward Lang’s face in an attempt to blind him  
* Ran for the exit...

…but rolled a 7 on Athletics, tripping near the Biblioplex doors.

### The Aftermath

Ross looked up to find Dean Kianne standing over him. After a silent standoff:  
“-10 Group Cup Points. Now get out of here.”  
Ross made his way back to the dorms — bruised, scorched, and slightly more famous than before.

### Session Themes

* Bold, rule-breaking research in pursuit of magical truth  
* Hidden magical research being guarded from lower-year students  
* Reinforced pattern of faculty involvement and secrecy  
* The first official loss of Group Cup points

### Ongoing Threads

* What exactly is the black goo, and why is it linked to mimics, frogs, or animated objects?  
* What are the Shield Guardians guarding on the upper floor?  
* Will Cadoras reveal anything further about the books or what he saw?
