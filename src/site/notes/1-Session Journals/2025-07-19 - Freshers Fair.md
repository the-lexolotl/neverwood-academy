## Summary

The new students of Neverwood Academy kicked off their second day on campus by attending the lively and colourful Freshers’ Fair — a celebration of student life held in the [[2-World/Points of Interest/Archway Commons\|Archway Commons]] and adjoining Club Hall. The fair featured booths, magical demonstrations, enchanted snacks, and student reps eager to recruit.

### Exploration & Sign-Ups

The player group explored a wide range of extracurricular clubs and First-Year Job opportunities, giving them their first taste of the Academy’s vibrant community outside of the classroom.  
Each student interacted with club reps, deciding which clubs or job roles they’d like to join for the semester.

### NPC Interactions

Players mingled with several student NPCs, learning more about their peers and the subtle politics of Neverwood.  
Some conversations hinted at rivalries between clubs and student factions.

### Ochre Jelly Incident

Midway through the fair, a magical containment crate ruptured near the Club Hall, releasing a squirming [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/ooze/ochre-jelly-xmm\|Ochra Jelly]] onto the fairgrounds.

* The party rushed into action, showcasing their teamwork and courage.  
* The jelly was successfully subdued before it could harm any bystanders.  
* Faculty arrived shortly after, hinting that this may not be the last “accidental” incident.  
* This marks the second unexpected magical hazard to occur on campus in as many days…

### Session Themes

* Finding identity through clubs and jobs  
* Connecting with student culture  
* Early taste of magical crisis management  
* Rumblings of instability behind the cheerful façade

### Ongoing Threads

* A pattern of escaped magical creatures or objects ([[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic-xmm\|Mimic]], now Jelly)  
* First year students are gaining a reputation as dependable under pressure  
* Possible inter-club rivalries or secret conflicts among students
