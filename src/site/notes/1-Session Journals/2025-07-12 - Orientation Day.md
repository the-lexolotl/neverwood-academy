## Summary
The first-year students arrived at [[2-World/Hubs/Neverwood Academy\|Neverwood Academy]], greeted by the school’s signature Campus Guide Automatons — brass, floating, bookish constructs who directed them around the grounds and provided them with basic schedules and maps.  
The day began in the [[2-World/Points of Interest/Biblioplex\|Biblioplex]], the Academy’s vast central library and ceremonial hall. Students gathered alongside their peers to listen to two major speakers:  
Head Teacher [[2-World/People/Taiva Loreweaver\|Taiva Loreweaver]], who gave an inspiring and cryptic welcome about the power of knowledge and the weight of legacy.  
Professor [[2-World/People/Staff/Mavinda Sharpbeak\|Mavinda Sharpbeak]], Professor of Radiance and Guidance Counsellor, who encouraged students to seek truth in themselves as well as in books.  
After speeches concluded, all first-year students were officially divided into their year-long adventuring groups — including the player characters — and given their first challenge.

### Treasure Hunt Challenge

Each new group received a campus-wide treasure hunt assignment to familiarise them with key locations and staff. The players:

* Worked together efficiently, using problem-solving and teamwork to complete each clue.  
* Navigated key areas of campus with ease, including Whalebucks, first floor and snarl.  
* Completed the challenge with little to no setbacks.

### Mimic Incident

As the treasure hunt concluded, a brief but notable incident occurred near the Biblioplex archives:  
A [[3-Mechanics/CLI/bestiary/monstrosity/mimic-xmm\|mimic-xmm]] spawned, likely attracted to the magical clutter left by dozens of student groups.  
The party chose to intervene quickly and neutralised the mimic with minimal effort.  
Faculty praised the group for their initiative, though some whispered questions remain about how the mimic got there in the first place.

### Settling In

That evening, students were shown to their assigned dormitories and welcomed into the cosy, whimsical First-Year Common Room. There was time for:

* Socialising with other students  
* Customising their dorm spaces  
* Reflecting on the day’s events and the semester ahead

### Key NPCs Introduced

**Taiva Loreweaver** – Head Teacher of Neverwood Academy. Wise, enigmatic, and strongly attuned to magical history.  
**Professor Mavinda Sharpbeak** – Professor of Radiance (Silverquill), Guidance Counsellor. Warm, sharp-tongued, deeply invested in students' wellbeing.

### Session Themes

* Welcome to the Academy  
* Forming early bonds  
* Learning the shape and rhythm of campus life  
* Hints of magical instability (mimic spawn)
