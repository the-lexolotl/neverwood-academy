## Summary
Before confronting the ominous ritual chamber, the students of Neverwood Academy retraced their steps to the locked room they had bypassed. Burning down the door, they uncovered a hidden cache of gold and ruined tomes. Yet the sound of distant chanting drew them back, and Cyinth, unwilling to wait, pushed open the ritual door to face what lay within.

Inside, twelve xvarts encircled an orange cat—Miaukier—at the centre of their dark ritual. At the head stood their shaman, looming behind a bloodstained altar. The battle to save the familiar had begun.

### The Ritual Battle
- Glue blanketed the chamber in a Fog Cloud, disrupting the xvart’s sight.
- Milfjord charged forward, unleashing Fireball with his staff—then coolly lighting his pipe on the lingering flames.
- Cyinth and Lyra focused divine fury on the shaman with twin Guiding Bolts, while Vigilius and Harry coordinated to burn through the lesser xvarts.
- From her Bag of Tricks, Cyinth summoned reinforcements: two giant rats and a weasel to turn the tide.

The xvarts fell one by one, yet the ritual did not falter. Miaukier’s body twisted, sprouting scales and wings as the magic intensified.

### Mercy for Miaukier
In desperation, Cyinth proposed killing the cat to end the ritual. Glue intervened in bizarre fashion, transforming into a candiru to infiltrate Miaukier’s body before bursting free—wounding both cat and caster. The orange cat-dragon hybrid wailed in pain, frightened and broken.

With the shaman dead and the xvarts destroyed, the party faced a choice: finish the ritual’s victim or show compassion. They chose mercy. Glue reached out to the trembling creature, calming and befriending it. He pledged to return Miaukier safely to Neverwood, taking responsibility for its care.

### Aftermath
- Glue departs with the cat-dragon, guiding it back toward Neverwood Academy.
- Lyra and Cyinth remain behind to bury the dead and eradicate the last remnants of the xvart encampment above.
- The party will reunite on campus, but the consequences of the ritual—and the strange new form of Miaukier—linger unresolved.

### Ongoing Threads
- Miaukier’s Transformation – The cat has become something more, its fate entwined with Glue.
- The Shaman’s Ritual – Though interrupted, the ritual’s purpose remains unclear. What force were the xvarts attempting to summon 
- The Party Divided – With Glue departing early and Lyra and Cyinth staying behind, how will the group’s dynamic shift when they reconvene?**
