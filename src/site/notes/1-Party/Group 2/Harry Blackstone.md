- ðŸ“– "Goops, Goos and Gunk" â€“ a book on magical slimes and oozes
  Likely written like a bestiary/field manual, with diagrams, descriptions, and alchemical notes.
  Length: Medium (200â€“250 pages equivalent).
  Reading time: ~6â€“8 hours for a skimming read, ~12+ hours for full study and cross-referencing spells.
- ðŸ“– A notebook with handwritten notes on animating objects
  Being a notebook, this is much shorter but harder to parse (scribbles, shorthand, magical notation).
  Length: Short (40â€“60 pages equivalent).
  Reading time: ~2â€“3 hours to skim, ~5â€“6 hours to decode carefully.
- ðŸ“– A book on Aganazzar of Neverwinter (Evocation specialist)
  A wizard biography mixed with spell theory. These tend to be highly technical in parts, so slower going.
  Length: Medium-long (250â€“300 pages equivalent).
  Reading time: ~8â€“10 hours casual read, ~15â€“18 hours for deep magical study.
