# Traits

### Magical Tinkering
*TCoE, pg. 11*
Imbue a Tiny nonmagical object with a magical property of your choice: 5ft. radius light, up to 6 second long recorded message, emits odour or nonverbal sound, static visual effect including up to 25 words of text. You can affect a maximum of 3 objects at a time.

Magical Tinkering: 1 Action
Uses: 3

### Neverwood Initiate - Lorehold
*Homebrew*

You have studied some magical theory and have learned a few spells associated with the Neverwood Academy.
Your spellcasting ability for this feat’s spells is Intelligence.

[[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/thaumaturgy-xphb\|Thaumaturgy]] (Cantrip)
[[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/guiding-bolt-xphb\|Guiding Bolt]] (1st) 1/Long Rest

### Infuse Item
*TCoE, pg. 12*
Whenever you finish a long rest, you can touch up to 2 nonmagical objects, imbuing each of them with one of your artificer infusions, turning it into a magic item. You can attune yourself to the item the instant you infuse it, or you can forgo attunement so that someone else can attune to the item.
Your infusion remains in an item indefinitely, but when you die, the infusion vanishes after 3 days. The infusion also vanishes if you give up your knowledge of the infusion or you exceed your maximum number of infusions.

Infuse Item: (No Action)
Uses: 2/Special

### Artificer Infusions
*TCoE, pg. 12*
You have invented numerous magical infusions that rapidly create magic items. Each infusion tells you the type of item that can receive it and if the resulting magic item requires attunement.

Some infusions specify a minimum artificer level, and unless an infusion’s description says otherwise, you can’t learn it more than once.
