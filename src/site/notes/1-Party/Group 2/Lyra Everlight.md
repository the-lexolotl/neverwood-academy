# Traits

### Channel Divinity
*PHB-2024, pg. 70*
You can channel energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. When you use this class’s Channel Divinity, you can choose which effect to create. You can use this class’s Channel Divinity 2 times per Long Rest, but can regain one expended use after finishing a Short Rest.

If your Channel Divinity requires a saving throw, the DC equals your Cleric spell save DC (DC 12).

Channel Divinity: 1 Action
Uses: 2/Long Rest

Channel Divinity: Divine Spark: 1 Action
Channel Divinity: Turn Undead: 1 Action


### Healing Hands
*VGtM*

Once per long rest as an action, touch a creature and restore 1 hit points.

Healing Hands: 1 Action (1/ Long Rest)

### Celestial Legacy
*DMG*

You know the light cantrip. Once you reach 3rd level, you can cast the lesser restoration spell once with this trait, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Once you reach 5th level, you can cast the daylight spell once with this trait as a 3rd-level spell, and you regain the ability to do so when you finish a long rest. Charisma is your spellcasting ability for these spells.

### Trust Fund Kid
*Homebrew*

You've never really had to work for gold like everyone else—why start now? You have connections, and more importantly, a family that still pays your way.

**Benefits:**
-  Once per week, you can attempt to contact one of your wealthy relatives to ask for a financial allowance. Roll 1d100 and gain that amount of gold pieces.
-  This call takes the form of a Sending spell (requiring no spell slot or components), a letter via magical courier, or a nostalgic family heirloom that functions like a sending stone—your choice, flavoured to fit your background.
-  After each use, roll a DC 10 Charisma (Deception or Persuasion) check. On a failure, your relative is annoyed by your request. You still receive the gold, but next week’s DC increases by +2. On a success, the DC resets to 10.
-  If you fail this check three weeks in a row, your relative cuts you off—no allowance for the next 1d4 weeks. After this period, the DC resets to 10.

### Neverwood Initiate - Silverquill
*Homebrew*

You have studied some magical theory and have learned a few spells associated with the Neverwood Academy.
Your spellcasting ability for this feat’s spells is Charisma.
