# Traits

### Druidic
*PHB-2024, pg. 80*

You know Druidic and always have Speak with Animals prepared.

You can use Druidic to leave hidden message. You and others who know Druidic automatically spot such a message. Others spot the message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check but can’t decipher it without magic.

Leave Druidic Message: (No Action)
[[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/speak-with-animals-xphb\|Speak with Animals (1st)]]

### Primal Order
*PHB-2024, pg. 80*

You have dedicated yourself to one of the sacred roles.

Magician
You know one extra cantrip from the Druid spell list. You also gain a +1 bonus to Intelligence (Arcana or Nature) checks.

[[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/druidcraft-xphb\|Druidcraft]](Cantrip)

### Wild Shape
*PHB-2024, pg. 80*

The power of nature allows you to assume the form of an animal. As a Bonus Action, you shape-shift into a Beast form that you have learned for this feature (see “Known Forms” below). You stay in that form for a number of hours equal to half your Druid level or until you use Wild Shape again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die. You can also leave the form early as a Bonus Action.

**Number of Uses.** 
You can use Wild Shape twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
You gain additional uses when you reach certain Druid levels, as shown in the Wild Shape column of the Druid Features table.

**Known Forms.**
You know four Beast forms for this feature, chosen from among Beast stat blocks that have a maximum Challenge Rating of 1/4 and that lack a Fly Speed. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your known forms with another eligible form.

When you reach certain Druid levels, your number of known forms and the maximum Challenge Rating for those forms increases, as shown in the Beast Shapes table. In addition, starting at level 8, you can adopt a form that has a Fly Speed.

When choosing known forms, you may look in the Monster Manual or elsewhere for eligible Beasts if the Dungeon Master permits you to do so.
Wild Shape: 1 Bonus Action
Uses:2/Long Rest

### Wild Companion
*PHB-2024, pg. 81*
As a Magic action, you can expend a spell slot or a use of Wild Shape to cast Find Familiar without Material components. When you cast the spell in this way, the familiar is Fey and disappears when you finish a Long Rest.

### Neverwood Initiate - Witherbloom
*Homebrew*

You have studied some magical theory and have learned a few spells associated with the Neverwood Academy.
Your spellcasting ability for this feat’s spells is Intelligence.

[[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/purify-food-and-drink-xphb\|Purify Food and Drink]] (1st/Long Rest)


### Halloobabrew Crafter
*Homebrew*

*Prerequisite: Requires a Wisdom score of 13 or higher*
You have mastered the unpredictable art of crafting "Halloobabrew" — a spontaneous, organic concoction brewed from whatever nature (or your pockets) provides. You can craft these brews quickly in moments of crisis or downtime, but their effects are... wildly
