# Traits

### Serpentine Spellcasting
*MotM, pg. 36*
You know the [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/poison-spray-xphb\|Poison Spray]] cantrip. You can cast [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/animal-friendship-xphb\|Animal Friendship]] an unlimited number of times with this trait, but you can target only snakes with it. Starting at 3rd level, you can also cast [[3-Mechanics/CLI/spells/suggestion-xphb\|Suggestion]] with this trait. Once you cast it, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast it using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.

Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells when you cast them with this trait.
